# EventHub – Campus Event Discovery Platform

## 1. Project Overview
EventHub is a front-end web application that helps students discover and explore campus events organized by various councils such as CSI, E-Cell, Writers Club, and Student Council.

The platform uses an interactive card-based UI where events are displayed clearly, and users can view detailed event information through flip-card interactions. The focus of the project is on clean design, usability, and intuitive navigation.
